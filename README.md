I'll summarize the TeleAntiFraud-28k dataset based on your README and add the two sections you requested.

# TeleAntiFraud-28k

TeleAntiFraud-28k is the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. This dataset integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis, providing high-quality multimodal training data for telecom fraud detection research.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Samples**: 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs
- **Total Audio Duration**: 307 hours
- **Unique Feature**: Detailed annotations for fraud reasoning
- **Task Categories**: Scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification

## Dataset Construction Strategies

### 1. Privacy-preserved Text-Truth Sample Generation
- Using ASR-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio)
- Ensuring real-world consistency through TTS model regeneration
- Strict adherence to privacy protection standards

### 2. Semantic Enhancement
- LLM-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs
- Expanding scenario coverage to improve model generalization
- Enriching the diversity of conversational contexts

### 3. Multi-agent Adversarial Synthesis
- Simulation of emerging fraud tactics
- Generation through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies
- Enhancing dataset adaptability to new fraud techniques

## TeleAntiFraud-Bench

We have constructed TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from TeleAntiFraud-28k, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance and reasoning capabilities on telecom fraud detection tasks.

## Model Contribution

We contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model based on Qwen2-Audio, trained on the TeleAntiFraud training set.

## Examples

Explore our dataset examples to better understand the telecom fraud detection capabilities:

- [Case 1: Normal Conversation Analysis](example/case1think.html) - Detailed analysis of a legitimate phone conversation
- [Case 2: Fraud Conversation Analysis](example/case2think.html) - Step-by-step reasoning for detecting a fraudulent call
- [Evaluation Sample](example/eval_sample.html) - Representative sample from our evaluation benchmark
- [Model Output: Normal Conversation](example/result1think.html) - Our model's reasoning process on a legitimate call
- [Model Output: Fraud Detection](example/result2think.html) - Model's analysis and detection of a fraudulent call

## Multi-Agent Data Collection

To collect fraudulent conversation data:
1. Insert your API key in `multi-agents-tools/AntiFraudMatrix/main.py` (uses SiliconFlow API key)
2. Run the following command to generate fraudulent dialog text:
   ```bash
   python multi-agents-tools/AntiFraudMatrix/main.py
   ```
3. Results will be saved in the `result` directory

For normal conversation data:
- Use `multi-agents-tools/AntiFraudMatrix-normal/main.py` following the same process

## Voice Synthesis with ChatTTS

To synthesize speech from the collected text:
1. Install the necessary dependencies
2. Run the API server:
   ```bash
   fastapi dev ChatTTS/examples/api/main_new_new.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8006
   ```
3. Use any of the scripts in `ChatTTS/examples/api/normal_run*.sh` or `ChatTTS/examples/api/run*.sh`

  Modify the port in these scripts if needed, then run:
   ```bash
   bash ChatTTS/examples/api/run*.sh
   ```
